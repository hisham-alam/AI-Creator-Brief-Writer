Ad 1: "Bad Exchange Rates"

**Full Script:**
**Creator:** (Speaking directly to the camera, looking frustrated) I used to get so frustrated with how much money I would lose on bad exchange rates and hidden fees every time I sent money abroad.

[On-screen text: The WORST feeling]

**Creator:** It felt like I was just throwing money away. But then, I found [Product Name].

(Creator's expression shifts to happy and confident. Pulls out her phone.)

**Creator:** They use the real mid-market exchange rate. You know, the one you see on Google? And their fees are super low and transparent.

(A screen recording of the product's app appears, overlaid on the video. The creator points to the screen.)

**Creator:** Look, Iâ€™m sending a thousand dollars, and it shows you exactly what the fee is and the total amount the other person will receive. No hidden charges, no bad exchange rates.

[On-screen text overlay on the screen recording: Low, transparent fee!]

**Creator:** I've saved so much money since I switched.

(Screen recording disappears. Creator is smiling, holding the phone.)

**Creator:** So if you're tired of getting ripped off by bad fees, you have to try it.

**Video Concept Breakdown:**

*   **Brief Format:** Guidance
*   **Use Case:** Sending money internationally (e.g., to family, for business, or between own accounts)
*   **Target Audience:** Expats, international students, freelancers, and anyone who regularly sends money abroad. They are tech-savvy, value-conscious, and frustrated with the lack of transparency and high costs associated with traditional banking and wire transfer services.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Setting:** A clean, relatable indoor space, like a home living room or office. The background is simple and not distracting.
    *   **Props:** A smartphone is the central prop.
    *   **Camera Angles:** The video is shot selfie-style from a medium close-up angle, creating a personal and direct connection with the viewer. The creator maintains eye contact throughout.
    *   **Transitions:** The video uses simple jump cuts to maintain a dynamic pace. The key visual transition is the overlay of a screen recording of the app, which serves as a product demonstration.
    *   **Text Overlays:** Bold, simple text is used to emphasize key pain points ("The WORST feeling") and benefits ("Real exchange rate!", "Low, transparent fee!"). The font is modern and easy to read.
*   **Concept:** This video follows a classic problem-solution-resolution structure delivered in an authentic, direct-to-camera UGC style. It begins by hooking the viewer with a highly relatable frustration (losing money on fees). The creator's tone shifts from annoyed to relieved as she introduces the product as the hero. The core of the video is the product demonstration via a screen recording, which builds trust and visually proves the product's claims of transparency and value. The video concludes by summarizing the positive outcome (saving money) and presenting a clear call to action.
