Ad 1: "Wise Multi-Currency Account for Freelancers"

**Full Script:**
**Hannah:** As a freelancer with clients in the US and Europe, getting paid used to be a nightmare.
[On-screen text: The freelance struggle is real]

**Hannah:** My bank would take a huge chunk in fees and the exchange rates were honestly a joke.
[On-screen text: Hidden fees ðŸ˜© Bad exchange rates ðŸ˜­]

**Hannah:** But then I found the Wise multi-currency account, and it's been a total game-changer. Let me show you how it works.

**Hannah:** [Voiceover over screen recording] So, this is the Wise app. As you can see, I can hold money in different currencies, like US Dollars and Euros, all in one place.
[Visual: Screen recording of the Wise app dashboard showing balances in different currencies like USD, EUR, GBP]

**Hannah:** And the best part is this: for each currency, Wise gives you your own local account details.
[Visual: Screen recording taps into the USD balance to show an ACH routing number and account number. Then taps into the EUR balance to show an IBAN.]

**Hannah:** So my US client pays directly into my US account details, and my German client pays into my European account details. It's like having a local bank account in multiple countries.
[On-screen text: Get paid like a local!]

**Hannah:** This means no more expensive international wire fees for them or for me. And when I want to convert money, I get the real mid-market exchange rate. No markups, just a small, transparent fee.
[On-screen text: Mid-market exchange rate âœ… Low, transparent fees âœ…]

**Hannah:** [Back to selfie view] Itâ€™s saved me so much money and hassle. If youâ€™re a freelancer or run a small business, you need to check this out.

**Hannah:** Download the Wise app and make your international payments simple.

*   **Brief Format:** Guidance
*   **Use Case:** Freelancing / Receiving international payments
*   **Target Audience:** Freelancers, digital nomads, remote workers, and small business owners who work with and receive payments from international clients. They are typically tech-savvy, budget-conscious, and frustrated with the high fees and slow processes of traditional banking.

    *   **Creator:** A friendly and trustworthy person speaking directly to the camera in a selfie-style shot.
    *   **Camera Work:** The video primarily uses a static, medium close-up selfie shot. It cuts to a full-screen or picture-in-picture screen recording of the mobile app to demonstrate functionality.
    *   **Transitions:** Simple jump cuts are used to maintain a dynamic pace. A swipe or clean cut is used to transition between the creator and the screen recording.
    *   **Props:** A smartphone showing the Wise app.
    *   **Text Overlays:** Bold, simple text overlays are used to emphasize key pain points (e.g., "Hidden fees ðŸ˜©") and benefits (e.g., "Get paid like a local!"). Emojis are used to add personality.
*   **Concept:** The video follows a classic problem-solution narrative structure delivered in an authentic, user-generated content (UGC) style. It begins by establishing a relatable problem for the target audience (the high cost and complexity of receiving international payments). The creator then introduces Wise as the "game-changing" solution. The core of the video is a practical demonstration using a screen recording of the Wise app, where the creator walks the viewer through the key features that solve the initial problem. The video concludes by summarizing the benefits and presenting a clear, direct call-to-action. The overall tone is helpful and genuine, as if one friend is sharing a valuable tip with another.

    *   **Local Bank Details:** Get unique account details (e.g., IBAN, routing number) for multiple countries, allowing you to get paid like a local and avoid costly international wire fees.
    *   **Hold Multiple Currencies:** Manage and hold balances in 40+ currencies within a single account, providing flexibility and control over your international earnings.
    *   **Mid-Market Exchange Rate:** Convert money between currencies at the real exchange rate with no hidden markups, ensuring you get the most value from your earnings.
    *   **Low, Transparent Fees:** Pay only a small, upfront fee for conversions and transfers, eliminating the surprise of hidden charges common with traditional banks.
*   **CTA:** "Download the Wise app and make your international payments simple."
