Ad 1: "Wise Multi-Currency Account for the Self-Employed"

**Full Script:**
**Roberta:** "If you're self-employed like me, you know the struggle of getting paid by international clients. I get paid in US dollars, I get paid in Euros, and I used to lose so much money in conversion fees until I discovered the multi-currency account from Wise.
[On-screen text: Multi-currency account]

With Wise, I get my own local bank details for the UK, the US, the Eurozone, and so on, so my clients can pay me like a local.
[On-screen text: Like a local]

This means I avoid those high conversion fees from traditional banks...
[On-screen text: Low conversion fees]

...and I can hold my money in different currencies. For example, if I get paid in US dollars, I can hold it in US dollars and only convert it to my local currency when the exchange rate is good. Let me show you.

**Video Concept Breakdown:**
*   **Video Title:** "Wise Multi-Currency Account for the Self-Employed"
*   **Concept Type:** UGC Problem/Solution
*   **Brief Format:** Guidance
*   **Use Case:** Receiving international payments as a freelancer or small business owner.
*   **Target Audience:** Self-employed professionals, freelancers, content creators, and small business owners (ages 25-45) who work with international clients. They are digitally savvy, looking for financial tools to optimize their income, and are frustrated by the hidden fees and poor exchange rates of traditional banks.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Setting:** An authentic, well-lit, and clean home office or modern living room environment. The background should feel personal but not cluttered (e.g., plants, bookshelf, laptop).
    *   **Creator:** A single, relatable creator speaking directly to the camera in a friendly, conversational tone.
    *   **Props:** A smartphone is essential to showcase the product in action.
    *   **Camera Angles:** Primarily a static, eye-level medium shot to create a personal connection. A slight "punch-in" or zoom can be used for emphasis when introducing the solution.
    *   **Transitions:** Use simple, clean jump cuts to maintain a dynamic pace. A key transition involves an overlay of a screen recording of the app while the creator holds up their phone.
    *   **Text Overlays:** Use bold, minimalist on-screen text to reinforce the key benefits as they are spoken (e.g., "Multi-currency account," "Like a local," "Low conversion fees").
*   **Concept:** This is a direct-to-camera, single-person testimonial that follows a classic problem/solution narrative. The video opens by immediately establishing a relatable pain point for a specific audience (self-employed people dealing with international payments). The creator then introduces Wise as the hero/solution, clearly explaining its core function (local bank details). The concept relies on building trust through authenticity; the creator explains the benefits in their own words, focusing on tangible outcomes like avoiding fees and controlling conversions. The visual proof, a screen recording of the easy-to-use app, is crucial for substantiating the claims and demonstrating transparency. The video concludes by broadening the target audience call-out and providing a clear, direct call to action.
