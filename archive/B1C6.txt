Ad 1: "Making The Move From The US to UK"

**Full Script:**
**Narrator:** "One of the most stressful parts about moving from the US to the UK was figuring out my finances. I needed a UK bank account to get paid and to rent a flat, but I needed a proof of address to open a UK bank account.

Luckily, a friend recommended Wise, and it was so easy to set up. All I needed was my US passport and a US phone number. I was able to open a multi-currency account and get UK bank details straight away, so I could get paid by my UK employer and send money from the US to the UK with a really small, transparent fee.

It made a really stressful process so much easier, and having the Wise card on hand when I travel is great.

So if you're moving abroad, I can't recommend Wise enough. Download the app.

**Video Concept Breakdown:**
*   **Video Title:** "Making The Move From The US to UK"
*   **Concept Type:** UGC Storytelling / Problem-Solution
*   **Brief Format:** Guidance
*   **Use Case:** Relocating internationally / Moving abroad
*   **Target Audience:** Individuals in the process of moving to a new country for work, school, or personal reasons (specifically from the US to the UK in this example, but applicable to any cross-border move). They are likely feeling overwhelmed by the logistics and bureaucracy of setting up a new life, especially when it comes to finances.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Setting:** A personal, indoor home environment (living room or bedroom), creating an authentic, relatable feel.
    *   **Props:** Smartphone (showing the Wise app interface), laptop (showing the Wise website/transfer page), passport, and the physical Wise card.
    *   **Camera Angles:** Primarily a medium-close up shot, filmed selfie-style directly to the camera. Includes insert shots (B-roll) of the app on the phone screen, the website on the laptop, and a close-up of the creator holding their passport and the Wise card.
    *   **Transitions:** Simple jump cuts are used to move between the main narrative shot and the B-roll insert shots, keeping the pace engaging.
    *   **Text Overlays:** A clean, simple Wise logo appears at the very end of the video.
*   **Concept:** This video uses a personal testimonial to walk the viewer through a common and highly stressful problem for expats: the "catch-22" of needing a bank account to get an address, but needing an address to get a bank account. The creator begins by establishing this pain point in a relatable way. She then introduces Wise as the solution, framing it as a helpful recommendation from a friend. The narrative transitions to showing, not just telling, by using B-roll of the app, website, and sign-up process (symbolized by the passport) to demonstrate ease of use and key features. The story concludes by highlighting the emotional benefit—stress relief and peace of mind—and showing the tangible product (the Wise card).
*   **Hook Ideas:**
    *   "One of the most stressful parts about moving from the US to the UK was figuring out my finances."
    *   "If you're moving abroad, here's how to solve the biggest financial headache."
    *   "You need a bank account to rent a flat, but you need a flat to get a bank account..."
*   **Pain Point:** Moving to a new country is incredibly stressful because you can't get paid or rent a home without a local bank account, which is impossible to get without proof of local address.
*   **Key USPs:**
    *   **Easy, Remote Setup:** Open an account from anywhere with just your home country's ID and phone number, no local address needed.
    *   **Instant Local Bank Details:** Get functional bank details for your new country immediately upon sign-up, allowing you to get paid by employers or receive funds.
    *   **Low, Transparent Fees:** Send money between your international accounts with very small fees that are clearly stated upfront.
    *   **Multi-Currency Account:** Hold and manage money in multiple currencies within a single account, complete with a physical card for spending.
*   **CTA:** "Download the app."
