Ad 1: "The Must-Have Card for Your Next Trip"

**Full Script:**
**Roberta:** I don't know who needs to hear this, but you need a Wise card for your next trip. I'm Roberta and I am a travel content creator and this has literally saved me so many times while traveling.
**Roberta:** So, it's basically a multi-currency account...
[On-screen text: Hold up to 50 currencies]
**Roberta:** ...and you can hold up to 50 different currencies.
**Roberta:** And then, with the Wise card...
[On-screen text: Spend in 175 countries]
**Roberta:** ...you can basically spend like a local in 175 countries. Also, it automatically converts your money with the real exchange rate, which is amazing because you can save so much money on fees. And the best thing is that you can also withdraw money from ATMs with a really small fee, which is a game-changer.
**Roberta:** So, if you travel a lot like me or you're planning your next trip, make sure to get your Wise card.

**Video Concept Breakdown:**
*   **Video Title:** "The Must-Have Card for Your Next Trip"
*   **Concept Type:** UGC Hack/Tip Style
*   **Brief Format:** Guidance
*   **Use Case:** Travel / Spending abroad
*   **Target Audience:** Frequent travelers, travel content creators, digital nomads, and occasional vacationers who are financially savvy and looking to avoid high bank fees and poor exchange rates when spending money in foreign countries.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Setting:** An authentic, personal indoor space (like a bedroom or living room) with natural lighting and simple decor (e.g., plants) to create a trustworthy, "friend-to-friend" recommendation feel.
    *   **Camera Work:** Primarily a static, selfie-style medium shot. The creator speaks directly to the camera to build a personal connection. Quick jump cuts are used to maintain pace and transition between points.
    *   **Props:** The physical Wise card is shown prominently. A smartphone is used to show a screen recording of the Wise app, specifically highlighting the exchange rate feature.
    *   **Text Overlays:** Simple, bold, white text overlays are used to reinforce key numbers and benefits as they are mentioned (e.g., "Hold up to 50 currencies," "Spend in 175 countries").
    *   **End Card:** A clean, branded graphic featuring the Wise logo and a shot of the product.
*   **Concept:** The video is structured as a direct, authoritative recommendation from a credible source (a travel content creator). It begins with a hook that creates urgency and positions the product as an essential travel item. The creator quickly establishes her authority before breaking down the product's functionality in simple terms. Visuals are used to support the script at key momentsâ€”holding the card when introducing it and showing the app to demonstrate the "real exchange rate" benefit. The narrative flow is: Hook -> Establish Credibility -> Explain Core Function -> Highlight Key Benefits (USP 1, 2, 3) -> Relatable CTA.
*   **Hook Ideas:**
    *   "I don't know who needs to hear this, but you need a Wise card for your next trip."
    *   "If you're planning a trip abroad, this is the one card you absolutely need."
    *   "Stop letting your bank rip you off with travel fees."
*   **Pain Point:** Travelers lose a significant amount of money and face inconvenience due to poor exchange rates and high hidden fees when spending money abroad.
*   **Key USPs:**
    *   **Multi-Currency Account:** You can hold and manage over 50 currencies in one place, giving you ultimate flexibility.
    *   **Spend Like a Local:** The Wise card allows you to spend in 175 countries without the usual hefty foreign transaction fees.
    *   **The Real Exchange Rate:** Money is automatically converted at the mid-market exchange rate, saving you money compared to traditional banks' inflated rates.
    *   **Low-Fee ATM Withdrawals:** You can get cash abroad without the "game-changing" high fees charged by other cards.
*   **CTA:** "Make sure to get your Wise card."
